Steps for VPC

1) Create a VPC
2) Provide the CIDR block address 10.0.0.0/16
3) Create two subnets one in each AZ
4) Provide the CIDR block address 10.0.1.0/24 & 10.0.2.0/24
5) Create a new internet gateway and attach it to VPC
6) Create a new route table - myinternetrouteout-name
7) Add a route out to the internet 0.0.0.0/0 & ::/0
8) Configure the subnet associations and add public facing subnet to the route table called myinternetrouteout-name
9) Go to subnets and modify auto assign public Ip to Yes
10) To test this add an EC2 instance and SSH into the instance and try updating the kernel
11) add another instance to the private subnet and choose the default security group for the VPC
12) create another security group called myrdssg - ssh,https,http,icmp,mysql - from 10.0.1.0/24
13) Copy the private key stored in .pem file to a new file created inside the root directory of public instance.
14) change the permissions on the .pem file with command chmod 400 mypv.pem
15) Use this private key to now SSH into the private instance from the public instance.
16) Now try updating the private server kernel using the command yum update -y
17) Go to VPC create a new NAT Gateway
18) Add the route in the default private subnet to route all requests to the NAT Gateway that is in the public subnet 0.0.0.0/0 - Nat Gateway
19) Wait till the NAT gateway is created
20) Now run the update command in the private instance. It works beautifully.
